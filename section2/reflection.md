## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

From the article, I had never heard the term Zone of Proximal Development. I have practiced programming in the past and found that everything that I wanted to actually accomplish seemed a million miles away. My problem is I get too ambitious, then cannot complete the project. That is because the things I want to do require a significant amount of training well outside my ZPD. Operating within what I already know will allow me more opportunities to learn, and is a less sizeable and more efficient commitment.

Less about growth mindset and more about the process of learning to code is the line "You don't code in a vacuum". I always pictured programmers like the cliche master hacker who says "I'm in" after assaulting the keyboard for 15 seconds. The picture of a mysterious individual with that Anonymous mask that lives in a hole in Belize, and from the shadows either dismantles large organizations or just writes a really nice application for Google or something. I now know this is sOoooO wrong!! Programming is about collaboration and leaning on your colleagues. A true master programmer will be out helping us newbies and collaborating with whoever has a computer.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I fear no mistake or no challenge. I am always pursuing the next level, and if I'm feeling comfortable that is a sign to push the envelope. I am not afraid to ask for help, and I know I will need help for the rest of my life and career.

I am not very good at networking or operating within a community. Strangely enough, I also consider myself a people person and love meeting new people and having fun. The programming community is massive, but I'm not sure where I fit in or what I bring to the table. I'm not sure I would describe it as insecurity, but more-so a lack of understanding of the social norms in business and tech. For example, I like having friends, but I don't want 1000 friends always trying to communicate with me. I also don't enjoy or use social media, nor do I have any interest in doing so. These elements of my personality worry me, and I fear they will be to my detriment even if I end up being a talented programmer.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It went great! I enjoyed having to think on my own, and there was never any worry since the lesson material is a click away. It empowered me to recall information and put it into effect. I never felt uncomfortable at any point, the feeling of "Now I have to do this" was not scary since it was taught very well.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement compares conditions which are usually always in the form of variables. A daily life conditional would be:
````javascript
var sunOut = true
if (sunOut = true) {
  console.log("Open the blinds!")
} else {
  console.log("Don't even bother with those blinds.");
}
````
Any web application today certainly has a subscription model! And these models often have different tiers like "Free, Lite, Silver, SilverPRO, Gold, Platinum, PlatinumDeluxeProDeveloperKeyX-TREME" etc. Well these tiers all offer different privileges, and to check whether a user has them or not you'd need a conditional. Or a thousand.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

It is nothing more than a recipe. An initial condition `if` is checked, then multiple further conditions can be checked using `else-if`. Lastly, if none of the conditions are met, the final line `else` will tell the computer what to do. The computer will methodically go through every conditional until it reaches a point where the condition exists. It will then output as written and stop going through the list.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Use logical operators `&&` OR `||`

AND serves to function if both conditions are met, and OR serces to function if one OR the other conditions are met. I love logic gates, and I'm picturing how crazy logical operators for XOR, NAND, XNOR etc. must be and how they used in software.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I am interested in getting deeper into these statements. For example I know there are ways to make a very short statement instead of chaining one million else if's but I have completely forgotten how that works.
