## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

In my experience I wait too long. I try to exhaust every option I can usually, but often times I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I think I need to identify that threshold better. But when it comes to asking questions, I feel confident and believe I can excel at providing the relevant details and asking the right question.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number == Numbers.
String == A string of characters of many types, including special characters. I also learned that you can inject variables into them which was fun!
Boolean == True or False. This is very useful for yes/no 1/0 conditions.
Variables == Variables store these data for JavaScript. They can be static, changed later, and I'm assuming dynamic based on things such as user input.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// or */

Code comments are the human translation for your code. Comments can also take code blocks out of the game, disabling them for future use or deletion.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is something that you can store things in. Let's say you wanted to remember your parents birthday. A variable is kind of like your notebook, where you declare your parents birthday's into which are then stored in that notebook for your use. Your notebook is comparable to this text editor, the only difference is the text editor has many more complex features than a notebook ever could that let you use variables in highly useful and more practical ways.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I enjoy reddit and I'm sure they have a gazillion variables.
Upvotes and downvotes are variables that are stored as numbers.
Comments are all strings.
A boolean example they may use is to know if I am logged in or not. When true I would have access to all of the features of the website, perhaps when I'm logged out in which it would be false and I would need to authenticate my privileges by logging in? I'm probably super wrong!

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is marrying data types together. In the examples, we called on variables using Concatenation which when printed combined them all together. Turing seems to love analogies and I do to, so I picture it as a blender. Concatenation lets you make a smoothie instead of taking a bite of a banana and then a bite of a blueberry and then a bite of yogurt etc.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I enjoy chess.com and they concatenate pretty much everything! They always offer a post game analysis which concatenates multiple variables together and tells a concise story of the game.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

We printed to the console a lot in this section. In real practice, is console.log a huge thing or would you usually send the data elsewhere and not log it? Is console.log a test thing? I suppose I just wonder more about the big picture. Also, are there limits to the data types? Would I be able to store 100 trillion as a number or the Gettysburgh address as a string? What are the limits to what computers themselves can even handle?
